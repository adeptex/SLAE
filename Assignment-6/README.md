Student ID: SLAE-670

## Problem

- Take up 3 shellcodes from Shell-Storm and create polymorphic versions of them to beat pattern matching
- The polymorphic versions cannot be larger than 150% of the existing shellcode
- Bonus points for making it shorter in length than original

## Solution

The solution is broken up into three parts:

- ![dlexec](https://github.com/adeptex/SLAE/tree/master/Assignment-6/dlexec "dlexec")
- ![passwd](https://github.com/adeptex/SLAE/tree/master/Assignment-6/passwd "passwd")
- ![rot7](https://github.com/adeptex/SLAE/tree/master/Assignment-6/rot7 "rot7")
